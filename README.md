-   creates a personalized shopping list
-   generates a list of recipes that can be prepared based on the products in the user's refrigerator list
-   allows access to full recipes from a list of generated recipes and the ability to search for additional recipes or filter recipes based on a specific diet
-   allows user registration through a form requiring a name (nickname), email address and password, with the information stored securely in a database
